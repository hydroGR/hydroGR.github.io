<p>Before running a model,
<strong><font color="#009EE0">airGRteaching</font></strong> functions
require data and options with specific formats.</p>
<p>For this step, you just have to use the <code>PrepGR()</code>
function. You have to define:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ObsDF</code>: <code>data.frame</code> of hydrometeorological
observations time series</li>
<li><code>HydroModel</code>: the name of the hydrological model you want
to run (GR1A, GR2M, GR4J, GR5J, GR6J, GR4H or GR5H)</li>
<li><code>CemaNeige</code>: if you want or not to use the snowmelt and
accumulation model</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to use CemaNeige, you also have to define:</p>
<ul>
<li>catchment average air temperature in <code>ObsDF</code> or in
<code>TempMean</code></li>
<li><code>HypsoData</code>: a vector of 101 reals: min, quantiles (1 %
to 99 %) and max of catchment elevation distribution [m]; if not defined
a single elevation layer is used for CemaNeige</li>
<li><code>NLayers</code>: the number of elevation layers requested
[-]</li>
</ul>

<p>To calibrate a model, you just have to use the <code>CalGR()</code>
function. By default, the objective function used is the Nash–Sutcliffe
criterion (<code>"NSE"</code>), and the warm-up period is automatically
set (depends on model). You just have to define:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PrepGR</code>: the object returned by the
<code>PrepGR()</code> function</li>
<li><code>CalPer</code>: a vector of 2 dates to define the calibration
period</li>
</ul>
<p>You can obviously define another objective function or warm-up
period:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CalCrit</code>: name of the objective function
(<code>"NSE", "KGE", "KGE2", "RMSE"</code>)</li>
<li><code>WupPer</code>: a vector of 2 dates to define the warm-up
period</li>
</ul>
<p>The calibration algorithm has been developed by Claude Michel
(<code>Calibration_Michel()</code> function in the <a
href="https://hydrogr.github.io/airGR/">airGR</a> package) .</p>
