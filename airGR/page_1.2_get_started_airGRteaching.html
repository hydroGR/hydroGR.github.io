<p>Before running a model, <strong><font color="#009EE0">airGRteaching</font></strong> functions require data and options with specific formats.</p>
<p>For this step, you just have to use the <code>PrepGR()</code> function. You have to define:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ObsDF</code>: <code>data.frame</code> of hydrometeorological observations time series</li>
<li><code>HydroModel</code>: the name of the hydrological model you want to run (GR1A, GR2M, GR4J, GR5J, GR6J or GR4H)</li>
<li><code>CemaNeige</code>: if you want or not to use the snowmelt and accumulation model</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to use CemaNeige, you also have to define:</p>
<ul>
<li>catchment average air temperature in <code>ObsDF</code> or in <code>TempMean</code></li>
<li><code>HypsoData</code>: a vector of 101 reals: min, quantiles (1 % to 99 %) and max of catchment elevation distribution [m]; if not defined a single elevation layer is used for CemaNeige</li>
<li><code>NLayers</code>: the number of elevation layers requested [-]</li>

<div id="calibration-step" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Calibration step</h2>
<p>To calibrate a model, you just have to use the <code>CalGR()</code> function. By default, the objective function used is the Nash–Sutcliffe criterion (<code>&quot;NSE&quot;</code>), and the warm-up period is automatically set (depends on model). You just have to define:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PrepGR</code>: the object returned by the <code>PrepGR()</code> function</li>
<li><code>CalPer</code>: a vector of 2 dates to define the calibration period</li>
</ul>
<p>You can obviously define another objective function or warm-up period:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CalCrit</code>: name of the objective function (<code>&quot;NSE&quot;, &quot;KGE&quot;, &quot;KGE2&quot;, &quot;RMSE&quot;</code>)</li>
<li><code>WupPer</code>: a vector of 2 dates to define the warm-up period</li>
</ul>
<p>The calibration algorithm has been developed by Claude Michel (<code>Calibration_Michel()</code> function in the <strong><font color="#009EE0">airGR</font></strong> package) .</p>

<p>The <strong><font color="#009EE0">airGRteaching</font></strong> package also provides the <code>ShinyGR()</code> function, which allows to run the <em>Shiny</em> interface that is proposed on this page.</p>
<p>The <code>ShinyGR()</code> function just needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ObsDF</code>: a <code>data.frame</code> (or a <code>list</code> of <code>data.frame</code>)</li>
<li><code>SimPer</code>: a vector (or list of vectors) of 2 dates to define the simulation period(s)</li>
