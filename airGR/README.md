**airGR** is an R packages which brings into the [**R software**](https://cran.r-project.org/) the hydrological modelling tools used and developed at the [Catchment Hydrology Research Group](https://webgr.inrae.fr/en/) of [INRAE Antony (France)](http://www.inrae.fr/en/), including the [**GR rainfall-runoff models**](https://webgr.inrae.fr/en/models/) and a snowmelt and accumulation model, [**CemaNeige**](https://webgr.inrae.fr/en/models/snow-model/). Each model core is coded in **Fortran** to ensure low computational time. The other package functions (i.e. mainly the calibration algorithm and the efficiency criteria calculation) are coded in **R**.
